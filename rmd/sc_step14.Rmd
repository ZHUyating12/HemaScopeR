## Cell-cell interaction

Signal crosstalk between cells is crucial for cellular state and behavior. [CellChat](https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat) is used to infer and analyze the cell-cell communication based on the [tutorial](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/blob/master/tutorial/CellChat-vignette.html). The visualization of each cell-cell communication network is under [../Step15.Cell_cell_interection](..\\Step15.Cell_cell_interection). The circle plot of overall interaction information is shown as follows.

The incoming and outgoing signaling patterns are also shown as follows.
