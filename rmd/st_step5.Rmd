## Spatially variable features

Genes, whose variability in expression can be explained to some degree by spatial location, are identified
by [FindSpatiallyVariableFeatures](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/findspatiallyvariablefeatures) function in `Seurat`. 
The most significant `r n.top.show`` spatially variable expressed genes are shown below. All the spatially variable features are stored in [../Step5_SpatiallyVariableFeatures/SVF.csv](../Step5_SpatiallyVariableFeatures/SVF.csv).
