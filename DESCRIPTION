Description: HemaScopeR, a specialized bioinformatics toolkit designed for comprehensive analysis of 
             scRNA-seq and st-seq data derived from hematopoietic cells, including those from myeloid and lymphoid lineages.
             HemaScopeR enables researchers to delve into scRNA-seq data, including identifying 
             cell types, detecting differentially expressed genes, performing GO and KEGG enrichment, 
             analyzing gene networks, performing cell cycle analysis and gene set variation analysis (GSVA), 
             predicting trajectories, analyzing transcription factors, and exploring cell-cell interactions. 
             Additionally, it facilitates the extraction of niche information from st-seq data through spot 
             deconvolution, copy number variation (CNV) estimation, and analysis of spatial interactions.
