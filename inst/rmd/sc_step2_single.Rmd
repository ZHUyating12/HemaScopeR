The following arguments are used to filter data.

| Arguments | value | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meaning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `min.cells` | `r min.cells` | Include features detected in at least this many cells |
| `min.feature` | `r min.feature` | Include cells where at least this many features are detected |
| `percent.mt.limit` | `r percent.mt.limit` | Include cells where at most this percent of mitochondrial genes are detected |


```{r doublet, child=system.file('rmd', 'sc_step2_doublet.Rmd', package = 'HemaScopeR'), eval=Step2_Quality_Control.RemoveDoublets}
