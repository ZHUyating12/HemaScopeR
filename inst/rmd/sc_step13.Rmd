## Transcription factor analysis

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by the gene. TF analysis is performed using [SCENIC](https://github.com/aertslab/SCENIC). The output files and reports of `SCENIC` are located in [this path](..\\Step13.TF_analysis\\int). The inferred expressions of TFs in each cluster are shown in the heatmap.
